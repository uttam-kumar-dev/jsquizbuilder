# Simple JS Text editor and Quiz Builder

This is a simple text editor and quiz builder written in JS. you can see the live demo here [https://thequizbuilder.blogspot.com/](https://thequizbuilder.blogspot.com/)

This editor was created by me in **2019**, when i started learning JavaScript. at that time I have not enough experience in web technologies and I started a blog in blogspot.com . It is a free platform for new bie to start a blog. I also created the blogger theme for my first blog, but currently that theme is not available because of data lost.

In 2019 , I don't have enough experience to setup server. so i decided to host this quiz builder to blogspot.com, from **2019** to **present(2024)** quizbuilder hosted on blogger.

Today(19-01-2024) I am searching my some of old projects, then I find this project in my drive. So i decided to share the code publicly. you can use it anywhere. 

Now i am decided to rewrite the entire code to new code from now.

Suggestions and requests are always welcome.

Note : This project is just for learning purpose.

****
Please don't judge my code writing skill based on that project. it was created at that time when I was learning the JS, and most of the code written in mobile using keyboard and an OTG cable.
